# CRUD with NextJS

This is a simple Create, Read and Delete Suppliers list created with NextJS (ReactJS Framework). No ORM, no Tailwind, no Material UI. Made with CSS and PostgreSQL.

---

## Needed

docker
docker-compose

### Running the application

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will pull the `postgres:alpine` Docker image, build the application container from the included Dockerfile, and run both services. The application will be available on port `3000`, and can be access in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
